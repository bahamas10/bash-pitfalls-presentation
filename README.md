# 5 Bash Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

## Abstract

Bash is one of the most common shells you'll encounter in the wild (and probably
already on your laptop as the default). A lot of people know enough syntax to
get by, but not enough to avoid complex situations involving variables, quoting,
escaping special characters, etc. This talk will go over 5 common mistakes and
hopefully leave the listener with the tools and knowledge to avoid these
mistakes in the future.
